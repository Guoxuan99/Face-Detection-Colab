# Face-Detection-Colab
Extra Project - Clone of existed project online - Face Detection Colab - Using OpenCV's Haar Cascade to do face detection on Webcam image and video on Google Colab..

Original Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjWh7QvVH60&t=636s

Aim of the Project: This project is to improve the **[Face Mask Detection System](https://github.com/Guoxuan99/Face-Mask-Detection-System)** which is also using 
Google Colab as the platform to detect whether you are wearing a mask or not.The problem on the previous project is it will display picture by picture even using real time webcam.
Now, with the overlapping technique proposed in this project, we can overlap the label on the real time video itself.
